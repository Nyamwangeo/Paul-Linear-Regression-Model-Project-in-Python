Ever wondered if there are stats that can justify how much a team should pay for a footballer? Beyond Messi and CR7, many other players can be analyzed on a range of benchmarks to determine if the team shall get value out of the investment. This project explores some data while demonstrating critical Linear Regression skills in addressing similar problems. 
The English Premier League is one of the world's most-watched soccer leagues, with an estimated audience of 12 million people per game. With the substantial financial benefits, all significant teams of EPL are interested in Analytics and AI. Regarding sports analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have become extremely popular. The sports entertainment sector and the relevant stakeholders extensively use sophisticated algorithms to improve earnings and reduce business risk associated with selecting or betting on the wrong players. 
Regression is one of the foundational techniques in Machine Learning. As one of the most well-understood algorithms, linear regression plays a vital role in solving real-life problems. In this project, we wish to use Linear Regression to predict the scores of EPL soccer players.
